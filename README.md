# APCS_stuff

here are some of the "harder" hw assignments assigned in apcs at lahs (and maybe other schools idk)

**Files:<br/>**
- AP1.java - don't actually know why i have this here but uh yeah it wasn't hard it was kind of just busy work (mc was even easier)<br/>
- BinarySearchTree.java - an introduction to finding and putting elements in a search tree<br/>
- MaxSubsequenceSumTester.java - a project given to us to learn about lowering the complexity of an algorithm<br/>
- SearchLibrary.java - introduction to algorithms, specifically binary sort vs selection sort<br/>
- SortLibraryQuickSort.java and SortLibraryQSNoComment.java - quicksort (one with comments and one without) <br/>
- partition step - the partition step code only for quicksort<br/>

**Folders:<br/>**
- Paint - refactor paint we did as a small paint program as an intro to graphics<br/>
- StreichardtCarstenYahtzeeGame - the yahtzee project we made as a partner thing (altho i chose to work alone because i didn't want to -hardcode absolutely everything) idk if fully functional since i can't possibly test every case but it is playable and should work 99.9% of the time<br/>
- SubKiller - a project with spaghetti starter code as the teacher gave us videos showing us how to rework it into a better, more elegant object-oriented program <br/>
- Webcats:<br/>
  - Functions.java (ch2) - simple subroutine calls<br/>
  - LoanCalculator.java (ch3) - one of the earlier webcats on string formatting that people seemed to have trouble on<br/>
  - MosaicCreator.java (ch4) - introduced us to APIs and methods -- beware of rectangles!<br/>
  - Ch5 Folder (RewardsCreditAccount.java and CreditAccount.java) - object oriented programming practice
  - SortLibrary.java (ch7) - 4 sorts : bubble, insertion, selection, and merge (the only nlog(n) there)<br/> 
  - LinkedListOfStrings.java (ch9 p1) - linked list ch9 webcat (i think a lot of it is quite inefficient but it passes all the junit tests) <br/>
  - PersonDatabase.java (ch9 p2) - binary tree portion of the webcat (man this took like so long just cuz i had typos and stuff eeee)<br/>
