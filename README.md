sortlibrary and searchlibrary (and i guess the other hard ones)

here are some of the "harder" hw assignments assigned in apcs at lahs (and maybe other schools idk)

Paint - refactor paint we did as a small paint program as an intro to graphics<br/>
SubKiller - a project with spaghetti starter code as the teacher gave us videos showing us how to rework it into a better, more elegant object-oriented program <br/>
LoanCalculator.java - one of the earlier webcats on string formatting that people seemed to have trouble on<br/>
MaxSubsequenceSumTester.java - a project given to us to learn about lowering the complexity of an algorithm<br/>
SearchLibrary.java - introduction to algorithms, specifically binary sort vs selection sort<br/>
SortLibrary.java - 4 sorts (was a webcat): bubble, insertion, selection, and merge (the only nlog(n) there)<br/>
